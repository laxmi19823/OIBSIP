    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>Here are some of my recent experiences:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>Experience 1:</h3> <h4>Co-Author Experience at Oceanic Publications:</h4><br>
          <p1>As a beginner in the literary world, I had the privilege of collaborating with Oceanic Publications, 
            a renowned publishing company committed to quality and diversity.
             Together, we co-authored a book titled "Beauty of Nature,"
              a captivating exploration of the natural world's wonders. 
              This experience not only honed my writing skills but also taught me the 
              importance of teamwork and creativity in crafting compelling stories.</p1>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Experience 2: </h3> <h4>Content Writing Intern at Centle:</h4><br>
        <p2>
            As an intern content writer at Centle, I've been crafting engaging and
             informative content for the past month. My role involves creating compelling 
             narratives that highlight Centle's mission to empower students for the workforce 
             of tomorrow. Through my writing, I aim to showcase the platform's 
             dedication to student success and its commitment to providing valuable
              resources for both students and employers. Joining Centle has been an 
              exciting opportunity to contribute to a startup that's making a real difference in shaping the future workforce.
